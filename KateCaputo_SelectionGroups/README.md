Using the Maya Script Editor, I built this Selection Groups tool in Python. My tool allows Maya artists to build custom sets of objects within a scene which can be used for organization, simplified selection and keying of control curves during animation, and grouping without altering hierarchy.

The script functions by writing selection group information to a .txt file within the Maya project, and reading in the information upon launch in order to preserve past groupings.

From conceptualization to completion of this tool, I consulted with Maya artists weekly to gather feedback on functionality, prioritization of the most useful features, and the logic and usability of the UI. With my goal of creating a tool beneficial for artists which would expedite and facilitate their process, this feedback was invaluable.
