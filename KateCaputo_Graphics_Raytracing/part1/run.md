# Run.md

- I used cpp for this code
- ran build.py and compiled to create an executable called 'lab'
- generate image by running **./lab**
- this will create 1 output image called 'output1.ppm inside the 'part1' folder

**CONCRETE REQUIREMENT HELP*
- OBJECT REQUIREMENT: obj loaded and created in main.cpp, work done in OBJ.hpp and OBJ.cpp
- most of new work within OBJ.cpp is at the bottom of the OBJ constructor
- also created a new hittable object class Triangle.hpp and .cpp to be able to handle this data (and built in hittable class inheritance where I didn't have it before)
