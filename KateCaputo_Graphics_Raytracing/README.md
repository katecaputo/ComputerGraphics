  * Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!

  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
    the most interesting part of this assignment was finding all the different approaches to the issue of projecting texture coordinates. I went through several different iterations, involving barycentric coordinates, matricies and rotation, dot and cross products, all before landing on this final iteration of the computations. Each method worked partway and likely could have been tweaked to work on its own but my code definitely went though several different phases.
