For this group project, my team and I created a cafe-themed pickup game in Unity. While my teammates were responsible for the models, environment and prop design, audio, and character animation, I was responsible for all the scripting aspects which enabled gameplay. This involved a time-based 'strike' system, pick-up, carry, and place functionality, randomization of drink assignments, and table identification for correct vs incorrect gameplay.

I also was responsible for working within the Unity interface to ensure that my scripts worked and connected with the assets which were sent to me. I managed scene navigation and the assembly and placement of all 2D assets.

This folder holds the scripts only, along with a video walkthrough of the game, however the entire Unity project is available upon request.
Please note that in the video walkthrough, the 'win score' is currently set to 1 for simplicity.
