For this group project, my team and I created a Cafe-themed pickup game in Unity. While my teammates were responsible for the models, environment and prop design, audio, and character animation, I was responsible for all the scripting aspects which enabled gameplay.

I also was responsible for working within the Unity interface to ensure that my scripts worked and connected with the assets which were sent to me.

This folder holds the scripts only, along with a video walkthrough of the game, however the entire Unity project is available upon request.
