With this Maya tool, I experimented with building a simple ray tracer, inspired by my computer graphics projects and Peter Shirley's text on raytracing, entirely within the Maya script editor. As my intention was not to build a fully-functioning, powerful ray tracer within these constraints, I used this exercise as a means to experiment with my scripting abilities withing Maya and Python.

This 'tool' outputs a .ppm file of desired height, width, filepath, and name that depicts a single triangle in the scene. It takes camera information from the scene and applies it to the raytracer and works with an accompanying Vector3 class which can also be found in this repository.

Though the tool does not have direct application in an animation pipeline, through its iteration and conception I was able to improve my Python and Maya scripting abilities, test the limits, strengths, and weaknesses of the Maya script editor, experiment with incorporating scene information into my code, increase my familiarity with the scripting for Maya GUI tools, and revisit my work on building ray tracers.
